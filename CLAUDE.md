- Dont ever guess anything. Check facts ALWAYS.
- Think before coding.
- Don't assume.
- Don't hide confusion.
- Don't be afraid to ask questions.
- Don't be afraid to say "I don't know".
- Don't be afraid to say "I don't understand".
- Surface tradeoffs.
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, state them and ask which one is correct. Don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- Simplicity first.
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.
- Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
- When editing existing code:
    - Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
    - Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
    - Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
    - If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
- When your changes create orphans:
    - Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
    - Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.
- Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
- Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
    - "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
    - "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
    - "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
    1. [Step] → verify: [check]
    2. [Step] → verify: [check]
    3. [Step] → verify: [check]
- Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification. 
- These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
- Favor smaller commits. Single responsability that concentrate on one concept/part/story/feature/struct
- Single responsability principle always
- Never EVER deploy anything to anywhere without being explicitly told to. Things like terraform apply for example.

## frontend-specific

- Stack: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit. `npm run typecheck` + `npm run lint` + `npm run test:ci` is what CI runs.
- `VITE_USE_STUB=true` (committed default) runs a fake in-memory backend; it does not cover users/members. Don't mistake stub data for live behaviour.
- This is a management/CRUD console today; a rethink toward directing agentic work is planned (ROADMAP #42). Don't assume task/team/PR/meeting surfaces exist here yet.
